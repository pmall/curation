"""The derived datasets (`docs/datasets.md`), exported from Drakkar (read-only on the
database).

uv run database-export <generic> <dir> [--run <id>] [--special-run <id>]

Writes to the directory five datasets, each as a `.tsv` file, tab-separated under a header
line, and an `.xlsx` file, the same lines; each name ends with `run` and the name of the last
vh run exported by ID, special runs aside, each character other than a letter, a digit or `-`
made a `-` (`descriptions_vh_run87`):

- `descriptions_hh`: the live descriptions of every hh run whose two human interactors are on
  their current snapshots, in Swiss-Prot. Sorted by stable ID.
- `descriptions_vh`: the live descriptions of the vh runs exported whose human interactor is on
  its current snapshot, in Swiss-Prot; the viral interactor on any snapshot, with its species and
  generic viral protein from the files of `<generic>` (`database/generic/`). Sorted by stable ID.
- `interactors_viral`: the sequence of each viral interactor of `descriptions_vh`, its canonical
  sequence from start to stop. Sorted by its columns.
- `mappings_h`: the mappings of the human interactors of `descriptions_hh` (both sides) and
  `descriptions_vh`; `mappings_v`: those of the viral interactors of `descriptions_vh`. Each with
  its interactor, and the isoform it is found on: the canonical one when the mapping occurs on
  it, else its other isoform with the lowest number. One line per (stable ID, sequence,
  isoform), so a homodimer's mapping on both sides is one line; the sequence's extra end
  residues in lowercase (`mSTNPK`); in `mappings_h`, `target`, `h` or `v`, the kind of the other
  interactor. Sorted by their columns.

The vh runs exported: those up to `--run`, special runs aside, and the special runs up to
`--special-run`, by ID; all by default. Nothing is written when `<generic>` is not in step with
the descriptions exported. The `.tsv` files written are read back and checked against each
other and against the database (`check_export`); a failure ends the command with an error, the
files left for a look.
