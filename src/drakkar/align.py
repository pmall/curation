"""Mapping occurrences: where a mapping is found on the isoforms of its interactor.

A mapping is the whole sequence used in the experiment; its extra end residues, not on the
interactor (an initiator methionine, residues of the polyprotein past a mature protein, a tag),
are named in `nter` and `cter` and left out of the occurrences. In the files, they are written in
lowercase at the ends of the sequence (`mSTNPK` is `nter` M).

The occurrences follow fixed rules, so a mapping on given sequences always gets the same ones:

1. Exact matches come first: if the mapping is found exactly on an isoform, its occurrences are
   the exact matches, on every isoform that has one.
2. Otherwise the mapping is aligned on each isoform (BLOSUM62, gaps -10/-2, the protein free
   beyond both ends of the mapping). The isoforms that reach the best score keep every placement
   of their optimal alignments, each with the highest identity among its alignments.
3. On each isoform, overlapping placements form one cluster (chains included), which keeps its
   first placement: the smallest start, then the smallest stop.

Identity is identical residues over the alignment length: the mapping plus the protein residues
facing a gap inside it (`docs/glossary.md`). U, O and J, which BLOSUM62 does not score, are
aligned as X.
