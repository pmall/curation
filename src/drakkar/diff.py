"""Diff the descriptions of one publication, as curated, against its live descriptions.

A curation gives the whole list of a publication's descriptions; the diff says what writing it
would change (`docs/tools.md`). Descriptions are matched on what makes them one description
(`glossary.md`): method, human accession, viral accession and coordinates, empty
coordinates being the full protein. A matched description whose generic name or mapping
sequences differ is revised, with the curation's note as it is; `below_threshold` is not
compared, it follows from the mappings.
A curated description without a match is added, a live one without a match is deleted. The
publication is given, so an empty list deletes every live description.
