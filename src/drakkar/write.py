"""Write descriptions and publication states (`docs/tools.md`).

Three functions, one per kind of write: `add_descriptions`, `revise_descriptions`,
`update_publications`; `write_batch` runs the three on a curation batch.
Each writes its lists in one transaction:

1. every row is applied in its own savepoint; a row with a problem is not written, and its
   problems are reported with its number;
2. every invariant is checked on the whole database as the transaction sees it (`check.py`);
3. the transaction is committed only with `commit=True`, no row problem and no error. Otherwise
   it is rolled back: a dry run is the same code as a commit.

Rows are checked only for what they build on: the publication, the snapshots, the method, the
coordinates, the mappings; never the note. What involves other descriptions (duplicates, generic
names) is left to the full check, on the result of the whole list: a rename carried by several
descriptions passes through inconsistent states and is valid at the end.

A description note carries no date (its version has `created_at`); a publication note keeps the
notes of its passes, the newest first.
